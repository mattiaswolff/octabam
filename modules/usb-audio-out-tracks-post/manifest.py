"""USB AUDIO OUT TRACKS POST -- USB AUDIO with the sixteen track channels after
each track's own MAIN gain.

High speed: the eight tracks' L/R on channels 1-16, each block multiplied by
the gain core 0 gives that track in the MAIN mix -- track LEVEL, mute, solo
and XLV (the crossfader's scene level), with core 0's 16-sample ramp -- and
MAIN_LEVEL left out. Full speed: the stereo sum of those stems. USB AUDIO
OUT TRACKS MAIN CUE's source (markandrus/octemu, MIT) assembled with
USB_LAYOUT = 5; the POST layout is allmyfriendsaresynths's (@clickysteve).
The XLV curve is the first quarter of payload A's sine at X:0x6c00, extracted
from the user's own stock image when the remix is built (no stock bytes in
the repo). It takes the same hook sites as the other USB AUDIO OUT modules,
so a remix carries one of them. README.md.
