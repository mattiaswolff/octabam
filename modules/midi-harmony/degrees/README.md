# Degree roots and persistence

Internal implementation of [MIDI Harmony](../README.md). C files are the
authoritative source; regenerate assembly with `python3 modules/midi-harmony/degrees/generate.py`
and verify drift with `--check`.

## Musical contract

OFF uses native NOTE and NOT2–4. HARM NOTE and CHORD use one degree/register
value, displayed as `1:3` (degree 1, tonic octave 3). Degree 7 advances to
degree 1 of the next tonic octave. Thus `7:3` is B-flat3 in C minor but C4 in
D minor. Octave names follow the native display (MIDI 60 = C4).

When a fresh or missing Harmony value requires a fallback, use `1:3`,
resolving to C3 under C major. Existing native notes are converted on entry;
the fallback does not replace them.

- OFF -> HARM converts absolute NOTE into degree/register using the applicable
  KEY. Nearest in-scale pitch wins; exact ties choose the lower pitch.
- NOTE <-> CHORD keeps the degree unchanged.
- KEY changes while HARM is active preserve degrees and change resolved pitches.
- HARM -> OFF writes resolved roots into native NOTE before native playback
  resumes. It preserves NOT2–4. It does not restore old absolute roots.
- A later OFF -> HARM uses the KEY at that later transition, establishing new
  degrees. KEY changes while OFF receive only stock processing.
- KEY OFF uses C major for degree conversion/resolution. Existing no-scale
  chord recipes remain unchanged (TRI makes major intervals on the root).
- TRAN/arranger offsets operate on resolved pitches, once. They are not baked
  into stored roots during conversion. Voicing, spread and ROOT are likewise
  output treatments, never inputs to representation conversion.
- Scale-derived CHRD choices adapt to the current scale. Explicit MAJ/MIN/DOM7
  preserve their interval recipes.
- A degree outside the MIDI range is silent in HARM. On conversion to OFF,
  which has no separate silent-root representation, it commits to the nearest
  MIDI boundary (0 or 127). It never wraps octaves or removes a root lock.

## Data and lifecycle contract

Native NOTE always remains a valid pitch or its native unlocked sentinel.
Harmony degree defaults and locks are separate data. Only the selected
representation is authoritative; conversion synchronizes at OFF/HARM boundaries.
Degree locks preserve native lock presence and Part-default inheritance.
Edits publish each root and its native snapshot together under a short
interrupt mask. Recording uses the same boundary; bank retention runs after
interrupts are restored. Clearing a HARM root removes its native mirror with
the degree so an intervening reader cannot reconstruct the deleted value.

HARM, Follow, voicing, DEG and CHRD defaults belong to each native Part.
Explicit DEG/CHRD locks stay with their patterns. An explicit HARM edit converts
the edited Part's default and its attached pattern roots. Recall inherits the
incoming Part's defaults. HARM-to-OFF locks preserve the outgoing scale's root;
for example, C-minor 1:3 becomes native C3 even when the incoming OFF Part has
D-minor KEY. A transient outgoing snapshot protects replacement of the same
physical slot. Inactive patterns retain their last scale until next used.

Native Part Save/Reload/copy/clear carries defaults directly. The companion
contains only 128 pattern/track root records: 64 degrees, 64 native edit
snapshots, representation, outgoing scale and context. Reusable slot context
is detached on load and before replacement. Part assignment and defaults are
excluded from the native pattern fingerprint. Dirty flags and retained mirrors
follow native bank ownership.

Native pitch consumers and generated note ownership receive real pitches.
Recording captures degree identity at the event, not a later queue-consumption
KEY. Releases retain their original track and emitted pitches. Pending events
cannot mix old representation data with a new mode. UI reads do not regenerate
AUTO voicing. The UI queue boundary reconciles the selected pattern even when
stopped; no trig is required for an OFF/HARM mode boundary.

Copy, paste, undo, clear, new trigs, new projects, bank load/store/reload,
Part save/reload/copy, Save As and battery retention carry the degree data
alongside their native counterparts. Corrupt or mismatched storage cannot
publish partially validated data. A rejected working save cannot overwrite
the stored bank/companion backup. Native bank and companion writes remain
separate filesystem operations; arbitrary power-loss atomicity is not claimed.
No earlier experimental format is migrated. Harmony uses its own companion
identity and rejects incompatible experimental CHRD formats.

KITS uses the same native Part fields and requires no special adapter.
The optional MIDI SCENES adapter requires upstream PR #647 (MIDISC2.1).
Its [compatibility boundaries and validation](SCENES.md) are documented
separately. See [native Part storage and KITS boundaries](KITS.md).
