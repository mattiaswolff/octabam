# Native Part and KITS integration

Harmony and Follow use native Part settings. KITS needs no source changes.

## Current native storage and ABI

Each MIDI track has a native 36-byte SETUP record at Part offset `0x4e2`.

| Offset | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | Follow source |
| 5 | HARM OFF/NOTE/CHORD |
| 12 | Follow mode/response, bits 0/1 only |
| 13 | Remembered fixed octave |
| 15 | Remembered relative octave |
| 16 | Packed VOIC/SPRD/ROOT |
| 17 | Native KEY, read through the shared snapshot |
| 18 | Base CHRD, 0..7 |
| 19 | Base DEG, 0..83; default 35 |

Context is `bank*4+workingPart`, 0..63. Public shared entries preserve all
registers except d0/CCR. `mp_ui_context` identifies the selected Part;
`mp_play_context(d0=track)` identifies the per-track engine context, with
applied-engine fallback, never UI fallback. `mp_read`, `mp_write`,
`mp_read_key` and `mp_epoch` use explicit contexts. Getters distinguish UI,
playback and captured-event contexts deliberately.

MIDI PART STATE owns boot-safe ROM gates for native memcpy/init. During an
ordinary native working-Part replacement it publishes `mp_snapshot_bank`,
`mp_snapshot_parts` and the outgoing SETUP snapshot, then calls
`hd_part_before(d0=aligned Part address)` once per affected Part. DEG detaches
outgoing root/queued provenance and suppresses reattachment while the snapshot
is active, including Follow dependencies. Native bulk copying remains
interruptible. A short final publication updates epochs and releases the
snapshot. Unrelated Parts stay attached. The superseded degree-only copy
wrapper and its unused verifier have been removed.

Pattern roots are 131-byte records: 64 degrees, 64 native edit snapshots,
representation, outgoing scale and last context. One bank is 16,768 bytes;
CHRD plus roots is 24,960 bytes. Files use HDP2/version 2; retention uses
HDN2/version 2. Non-DEG CHRD uses CHD2/CHN2. Empty files use HDP0/CHD0.
Companions contain no Part defaults and ignore Part assignments/defaults in
their native fingerprint. Loads detach reusable physical-slot provenance.
Strict validation, failed-write protection and atomic publication remain.

## Verification

`verify_harmony_degree_kits_port.py --scenes --project DIR` checks 18
resident/nonresident mode transitions, incoming defaults, explicit locks,
held-note releases and unchanged Kit library data. Run the native KITS gate
as well. These checks use disposable virtual cards, not physical hardware.
