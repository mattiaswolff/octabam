"""Boot the image just built under the ColdFire port and check that every
DRAM payload octabam's loader carries actually lands.

For the current REMIX (the image at out/mainos_bus.bin):
  * the boot reaches the RTOS handoff, and the loader's entry ran exactly
    once while its `fatal` hang never did -- so every hash gate passed;
  * the octabam window (out/platform/runtime/runtime.bin, when the remix
    has DRAM units) reads back equal to the linked runtime -- except for
    bytes the runtime itself writes once it runs
    (midi-scenes' state words are the known case), which are counted and
    printed, not hidden.

SKIPs when the port is not built (`make emu-cf`) or the remix carries no
DRAM payload. What this cannot see: caches (the port has none), the
recorder, and anything after the handoff.
